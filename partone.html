<h1>CHAPTER ONE</h1>
<br>
<p>It was a warm Friday evening in Grahamstown. We had just finished our final week of lectures before the exams in the Great Hall. We were looking forward to celebrating the end of the Rhodes University year before the finals started in a weeks time. It was the final night out of the year in effect. </p>
<br>

<p>The party was going to take place in the Student Union buildings. </p>
