<h1>CHAPTER ONE</h1>
<br>
<p>It was a warm Friday evening in Grahamstown. We had just finished our final week of lectures before the exams in the Great Hall. We were looking forward to celebrating the end of the Rhodes University year before the finals started in a weeks time. It was the final night out of the year in effect. </p>
<br>

<p>The party was going to take place in the Student Union buildings. The Student Union Buildings looked over the Great Field where first team cricket matches were played. </p>
<br>

<p>I went back to my room in College House before the celebrations were to begin. I sat on my bed thinking of my girlfriend Angela. We had a new relationship, and had been seeing each other for two months. I stood up form my bed and walked to the window. Through it I could see the women's residence across the road, Atherton's it was called. Young woman in shorts and T-shirts were strolling towards the entry or lazing about on the lawn before the white fa√ßade of the building. I couldn't see Angela and looked towards her room on the fourth floor, which had a view of the western section of town, up towards the house where I had lived with my family before moving into College House in my first year at university.</p>
<br>

<p>At six o'clock, I went down to the residence bar, the Toot. It was a room outside the main building that had been converted into a drinking den. I didn't have many close friends at this residence. I had moved there because my father, who lectured in law at the university, had thought that it was a good idea. But most of the other male students, it was men only, were studying business or law, or were sportsmen and they weren't creative types like me, studying music and languages. But I got on well with them nevertheless. </p>
